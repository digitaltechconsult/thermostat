# thermostat
This is a thermostat I made with ESP8266 and OLED Screen

What you get:
- WiFi credentials are hardcoded;
- OTA sketch updates;
- a very basic web interface for managing the thermostat from computer or phone via network;
- some failsafe mechanisms for the heating unit and temperature sensor;

I will implement in a future:
- WiFi pairing
- HomeKit integration
- some kind of AI to manage the heating process automatically

Hardware:
- ESP8266 board with OLED screen (WeMos I think).

Disclaimer: use it at own risk. For me it works ok, but you should test it well.

License: just steal it, no need to thank me or something, although it would be nice if you do.
